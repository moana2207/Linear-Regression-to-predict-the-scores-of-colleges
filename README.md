# Linear-Regression-to-predict-the-scores-of-colleges
I've collected some data on the scores of the colleges such as Harvard, Standford. And now, we can use the Linear Regression Algorithm to predict their grades and ranking.
Use this Algorithm, you can also predict the scores of a exam, or to predict the socres of a match.

Welcome to have a try !
